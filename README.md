# Random Password Generator

## Description 
This project was motivated by my drive to understand how to random aspects on webpages process and their functions. I built this project to create tool for users to generate complex and secure passwords that they can use for everyday usage. Whether it be for personal, social media, or business/work accounts. This solves the problem as user has when creating passwords by making one with the click of a button. I learned the intricate steps involved with making a random generator and the complex code that can be placed in just one function.

## Usage
To use this one simply just presses the "Generate Password" button which prompts the user to answer questions regarding the options for their password. Then it generates a password based on length and includes random characters the user selected from the prompts. It can be found here: https://jdellis490.github.io/HW3-PasswordGen/
